This space is where I (0xFR0STY) publish hands-on notes and write-ups from my labs. Youâ€™ll find **reverse engineering**, **malware analysis**, **detection engineering / blue team**, and **DFIR** content aimed at practical defense. Iâ€™ll be digging deeper into the blue-team realm as I go.

## What youâ€™ll see here

### Malware Analysis
- **Static triage**: file metadata, packing/obfuscation clues, strings/imports, config-extraction approaches, and IOCs.  
- **Dynamic behavior**: process tree, persistence, registry/artifacts, filesystem impact, and network activity.  
- **Threat mapping**: relating behaviors to **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques and families/campaigns when appropriate.  
- **Takeaways for defenders**: detection ideas, containment tips, and what actually matters in production.

### Reverse Engineering (RE)
- **Disassembly/decompilation** workflows (Ghidra/IDA), function discovery, API usage, and control-flow reasoning.  
- **Unpacking/deobfuscation** at a high level (when legal/ethical/safe), focused on analysisâ€”not enabling misuse.  
- **Protocol/config understanding**: C2 formats, crypto usage, and data structures for better detections.  
- **Small tooling**: helper scripts/snippets that accelerate analysis or artifact parsing for blue-team tasks.

### Blue Team & Detection Engineering
- **Detections**: Sigma rules, Splunk/KQL queries, and Sysmon coverage (with event IDs, fields, and rationale).  
- **Telemetry strategy**: what to log, where to enrich, and how to reduce noise while keeping high signal.  
- **Validation**: how I test rules (benign simulations, replay, or lab detonation) and measure detection quality.  
- **Hunt notes**: pivots that worked, mistakes to avoid, and what Iâ€™d operationalize.

### DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response)
- **Triage playbooks**: quick decisions, scoping, and containment checklists.  
- **Forensics**: timeline building (e.g., bodyfile/plaso), memory basics (Volatility-style thinking), and artifact parsing.  
- **Case structure**: notes templates, evidence handling, and reporting thatâ€™s useful to stakeholders.  
- **Lessons learned**: what Iâ€™d change next time to shorten dwell time or improve recovery.

---

## How I work (tools & approach)
- **Tooling**: Ghidra/IDA, x64dbg, Sysmon, Sigma, Splunk, YARA, and small Python utilities for parsing/analysis.  
- **Focus**: clear reasoning, annotated screenshots/snippets, and **defender-ready outputs** (queries/rules/IOCs).  
- **Repeatability**: I outline environment assumptions and provide hashes/behavioral summaries so you can reproduce safely.

---

## Safety, scope, and ethics
- **No weaponization**: I donâ€™t publish step-by-step instructions to create or deploy malware.  
- **Sample handling**: hashes and redacted links only; **do not** execute samples outside an isolated lab.  
- **Defender-first**: content is written to improve defense, detection, and responseâ€”not misuse.

## Navigation & tagging
Posts will carry tags like `reverse-engineering`, `malware-analysis`, `dfir`, `detection-engineering`, `sysmon`, `yara`, `splunk`, etc., so you can filter by interest. Iâ€™ll also maintain an **Archives** page and an **About** tab with quick links to popular series.

---

## Whatâ€™s next
- A short RE note walking through static â†’ dynamic triage of a recent sample and turning that into a Sigma rule.  
- A DFIR mini-playbook for workstation triage with artifact hints and a Splunk search bundle.  
- A YARA rationale post: when to write it, where to deploy it, and how to avoid brittle rules.

If thereâ€™s something you want prioritizedâ€”specific families, telemetry questions, or detection gapsâ€”reach out and Iâ€™ll queue it up. Stay frosty. ðŸ§Š
